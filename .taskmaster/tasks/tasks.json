Local PostgreSQL configuration appears to be the root cause, as direct psql connections are successful but Prisma client fails to initialize. Issue has been escalated and will be tracked separately to unblock dependent tasks. Current workaround: proceeding with subsequent tasks while infrastructure team investigates connection issues.

Root cause identified as local PostgreSQL permissions conflict with Prisma client, despite successful direct pg client connections. Alternative approach implemented:\n\n1. Retaining existing manually created database schema and SQL scripts\n2. Creating version-controlled migration files directly in SQL format\n3. Implementing seed data scripts using native PostgreSQL commands\n4. Adding migration and seed scripts to CI/CD pipeline using psql\n5. Documenting schema changes in SQL files under /db/migrations directory\n\nThis approach maintains schema version control and deployment automation while bypassing the Prisma migration tooling issues. Manual schema and migration management will continue until Prisma connection issues are resolved in a future infrastructure update.\n</info added on 2025-08-09T14:54:40.859Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-09T15:07:54.635Z>\nManual migration system fully implemented and operational. SQL migration files and seed scripts successfully integrated into CI/CD pipeline. All database operations working correctly through native PostgreSQL client, including schema versioning, data seeding, and rollback capabilities. Migration files properly version-controlled in /db/migrations directory. NextAuth continues to function with JWT sessions, though Prisma adapter remains disabled due to unresolved P1010 connection error.
